# clojure-guava

This library provides a handful of Clojure wrappers around the
immutable Guava collections (`com.google.common.collect.Immutable*`).

The wrappers implement some of the `clojure.lang.IPersistent*`
interfaces despite *not* being persistent (in fact, they currently
provide no direct means of creating modified copies). This is
primarily so that `contains?` and `get` handle them as expected.

Please note that at this early stage the API is subject to change
without notice.

## Usage

There are two namespaces of interest to user code:
`clojure-guava.factories` and `clojure-guava.wrappers`.

The `factories` namespace provides functions for building the
(unwrapped) Guava immutable collections with the supplied contents in
a manner similar to that of `clojure.core/into`. These carry names
derived from the names of the constructed classes (e.g.
`ImmutableBiMap` -> `into-guava-immutable-bi-map`).

Usage example:

    (into-guava-immutable-bi-map [[:foo 1] [:bar 2]])
    ; => #<RegularImmutableBiMap {:foo=1, :bar=2}>

The `wrappers` namespace provides three functions:

1. `wrap`, which wraps a given immutable Guava collection in a
   Clojure-friendly wrapper;

2. `unwrap`, which extracts the Guava object from a wrapper;

3. `invert`, which inverts a BiMap (possibly wrapped and preserving
   the wrapped/unwrapped status).
